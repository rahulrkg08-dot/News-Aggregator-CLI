🚀 Excited to share my latest project: News Aggregator CLI!

I built a Python-based command-line tool to automate the collection and organization of news data. It bridges the gap between raw API data and usable datasets.

Tech Stack: Python, SQLite, Pandas, NewsAPI, Argparse

What it does: ✅ Fetches and cleans data from global news sources. ✅ Prevents duplicate entries automatically using SQL constraints. ✅ Allows users to filter history by date, source, or keywords. ✅ Exports tailored datasets to Excel/CSV for analysis.
